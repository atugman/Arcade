# Andrew's Arcade - Gaming Project

I have always loved video games, and wanted to use JavaScript to begin programming basic games.

I used HTML 5 Canvas and JavaScript to create and render the game, and Node.js/Express/Mongo/Mongoose to produce the leadboard.

Users' scores are automatically uploaded to the leaderboard when they click 'save' or when the game ends.
The users' scores will only update if the new score is higher than their previous high score.

The user can save their progress by clicking 'save,' but this will be reset to 0 if they lose the game.
This will prevent the user from being able to start every game at their saved score.

If the user saves their score and comes back to the game at a later time, they can click 'load' to start at their saved score.

While I will be focusing on other projects to round out my learning, this will be the first of many game creations.
